## Personal reflection  

I chose the Machine Learning Engineer role because it combines programming, mathematics, and problem-solving, which aligns with my interests and background. My current skillset matches the foundational expectations of junior roles, particularly in Python and basic machine learning concepts. However, the market clearly expects practical experience beyond model training, especially in deployment and real-world usage. Many postings emphasize production readiness, which is currently a gap in my skills. Deep learning frameworks also appear frequently and seem essential for specialization areas like NLP or computer vision. This semester, I would like to focus on learning PyTorch and basic model deployment using Docker and APIs. These skills would significantly reduce the gap between academic knowledge and industry expectations.
